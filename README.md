I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. My app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

It can be a specific number of characters in length including uppercase and/or lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers based upon the user's choices.
